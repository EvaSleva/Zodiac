This prototype has been made by Flora Maurincomme.

Interaction : 
Purpose of the final project -> Kinect
Protoype --> You can play with your mouse, but it is originally made for touchable screens. 

Game :  
When you touch a star contained in a constellation, this star will be brighter and make a sound. 
When a constellation is completed successfully, the name of the constellation will be written. 

Prototype : 
There are only 2 constellations, many more can be added. 
I am not the best coder but I have worked hard on this project even thought the results aren't as fantastic as I wanted...

Problems : 
I was working with Puredata for the sound but something went wrong, last minute problem.. I just settled a background music using just Processing. 
I'll try to fix it for the demo tomorrow, terribly sorry about that !
