I have included two versions of my prototype, a 2D version and a 3D version.

I started out making the 2D version, but on the day of submission I wanted to try and transform it into 3D. I did not have time to complete it properly, therefore I wanted to include both versions in the submission. The 3D version gives an idea of how it could look in 3D, even though there still are some errors and adjustments that need to be done, like making the constellations larger, and perhaps only showing one at a time.
My prototype focuses mostly on the gameplay and interaction (as much as it can without using the Kinect). The sounds and visuals need improvement, and the gameplay too for that matter, but it should give an idea of how I imagined it.

Turn up the volume in the PD sketch before starting.
