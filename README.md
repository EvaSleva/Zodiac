### 2. IDEA Description

The Zodiac App will offer a 2D dark sky environment that will present the user with one of 88 constellations. The user is geographically located in the centre of the Earth where only a small viewport of the sky is visible, which allows the user to scroll through in any Cartesian directions. The user will see the stars that constitute one constellation and will join the stars in the correct fashion that is associated to the Zodiac sign in question. Sound effects will be used and chords played for each correct star connection. 

"The brain is brilliant at joining up stars and seeing patterns - it is, of course, the same logic behind the popular children's puzzle of dot-to-dot. The constellations themselves are just such patterns but the term asterism is today taken as patterns of stars that are not constellations. They can be naked-eye objects, e.g. the Plough (Big Dipper), or telescopic/binocular ones e.g. the Coathanger. The stars can be unrelated chance alignments, e.g. Kemble’s Cascade, or part of a related cluster e.g. ET in NGC 457. There are probably many more out there waiting to be discovered – they really only become obvious when someone makes the connection and draws our attention to them. Oh and a good name helps too."
